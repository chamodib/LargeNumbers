# LargeNumbers
C++ Coding

Implementing a class called Natural that can add and multiply non-negative integers (natural numbers) with hundreds of digits, or more.

Arithmetic with such big numbers is actually quite useful in applications such as cryptography. Itâ€™s possible to implement big number arithmetic very efficiently using clever, polished algorithms. Through this assignment, I have mimicked the algorithms we learned in school for doing arithmetic.
